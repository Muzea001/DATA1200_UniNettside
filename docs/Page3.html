        <h1 class="Headere">On the role of the internet on modern society!</h1>
        <p class="paragraf">It is in no way a stretch to say that the internet has become one of the if not the most
            impactful aspect of
            technology in the modern time. Communication, access to information, discussion and entertainment are but a
            few of the services the internet has mad accessible to billions of people, these services have fundemental
            ties to politics, and the overall social structure of a society. It is safe to say that the internet has
            today completely replaced conventional debate/political conversation, and has become the defacto platform
            for such activities. This change has made debate and discussion not a priveleage of the few educated or
            resourceful individuals that would often times fill the debate spaces of the past. Online discussion and
            debate has now become accessible to everyone on the internet. <br> This change has of course had an enourmous
            impact on political discourse in general. As more people from more diverse backgrounds are able to engage in
            political discource, new ideas and perspectives are bound to appear, ones that perhaps did not see much
            light in previous times. The ease of access to information that the internet has created has also had an
            impact on the politics of today. Thanks to the internet, information today flows much more freely, and
            newspapers or tv-channels have lost the monopoly they once had. This has also allowed information to be
            spread around by almost anyone. This, one can argue could make it easier for citizens of a country to
            construct a more nuanced outlook on politics, and political affairs. But one could simultaneously argue that
            such a change could make it harder to seperate truth from fiction, hence the popular term “Fake news”. As a
            conclusion one could say that the internet has fundamentally changed politics forever.</p>
