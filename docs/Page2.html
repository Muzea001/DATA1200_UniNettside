        <p class="paragraf">
            Accessibility is a fundamental step in the creation process. The word accessibility means simply to reach
            people. Today when we are living in a world as connected as ever, the potential reach of one individual has
            expanded tremendously. It is therefore more important now than ever to assure good accessibility in any type
            of work. Our relationship with accessilibity during the creation of this website was two-fold. The first
            part was to keep accessibility in mind every step of the way. This assured that we did not have to make
            major adjustments to aspects of the website, whenever we tested the final product. Many of our design
            decisions we tested for accessibility before implementing in the first place. As an example one of the first
            things we considered at the beginning of the creation process was the color scheme that we wanted to
            implement. During this consideration, we used the WebAim Contrast Checker tool, to test different color
            combinations and try to achieve as good of a contrast ratio as possible. In the end we decided on a goldish
            yellow background/foreground and a soft black for its opposite, alternating between the two to create some
            change between the pages. This achieved a 9.95 Contrast ratio (see pic1 below).

            While writing our Html code, we also made use of the Nu Html Checker in order to test our code and make sure
            it was as clean as possible. When using this tool for the first time, many errors came up and we had to fix
            many of them along the way. For other minor errors we made the decision to not change them, that was because
            it was easier for certain elements to be the way they were in order for our group to be able to understand
            them. An example of this was the width and height for certain pictures we used being defined in HTML, this
            we did in order to achieve perfect circle shapes when using the border radius style in css (see pic 2). We
            then used the Css validation service tool in order to check our CSS stylesheet for errors. Thankfully this
            tool only came up with a few errors that required little adjustments to fix. (see pic 3).
            Regarding universal design aspects one of the things we made sure to work in accordance with was the aspect
            of Flexibility in use. We tried to order our HTML and CSS code in a way that could be easily read and
            understood even by someone who had not worked in this project. We also tried to make sure that our website
            was as easily read, navigated through and understood as possible. This included among other things to make a
            website layout that the reader would be familiar with. Lastly we considered the perceptible information
            aspect. In order to achieve this we had to communicate necessary information effectively to the user,
            regardless of their conditions or abilities. To do this we made text elements big/broad and easily readable.
            This also had a play in the way we developed our code, making us follow a relatively simple code structure
            and elements.
